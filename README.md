# Design-and-analysis-of-algorithms

In this repository i will upload every single problem I have solved that has been given to us in the design and analysis of algorithms course. Most of the problems have been taken from leetcode and I am using the LeetHub extension to automatically push into this repo.  

All of the solutions are mine and I haven't been looking in the internet for help. If that's not true I will always specify it. 

I will always try to solve the problems in the best possible way. Usually I will trade space for time. I will always try to be above the 50th percentile of users that has submited in leetcode.
