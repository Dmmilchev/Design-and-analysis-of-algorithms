# Design-and-analysis-of-algorithms

In this repository i will upload every single problem I have solved that has been given to us in the desing and analysis of algorithms course. Most of the problems have been taken from leetcode.  

All of the solutions are mine and I haven't been looking in the internet for help. If that's not true I will always specify it. 

I will always try to solve the problems in the best possible way. Usually I will trade space for time. I will always try to be above the 50th percentile of users that has submited in leetcode.
